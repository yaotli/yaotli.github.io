I am a PhD student in Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. My interests have been characterising different viral pathogens isolated from field or clinical context with an aim to understand their transmission patterns and to inform control measures. My thesis work focuses on a new lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus, usually called H5Nx, distinct from previously dominant H5N1 virus. By analyzing available viral sequences using evolutionary biology methods, I managed to relate the emergence of the new viral lineage to the population dynamics of the ancestral/co-circulating H5N1 lineages. I was also in charge of a field project using nanopore sequencing technique to study the current H5 endemic in Taiwan. I believe phylogenetic methods combined with advanced sequencing techniques will play a critical role in infectious disease control.
